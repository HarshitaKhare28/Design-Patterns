# 🎯 Design-Patterns

Welcome to the **Design-Patterns** repository! This collection demonstrates the most popular design patterns in **Java**, neatly categorized and implemented for learning and reference. Whether you're preparing for interviews, enhancing project architecture, or diving deeper into OOP concepts — this repo has you covered! 🚀

## 💬 What Are Design Patterns?

**Design patterns** are time-tested solutions to common software design problems. They offer templates for writing efficient, maintainable, and scalable code. Rather than reinventing the wheel, developers can use these patterns to build clean and robust architectures.

## 🔍 Pattern Categories

We've organized the patterns into three major types to make navigation easier and understanding clearer:

### 🏗️ **Creational Patterns** – Deal with object creation

| Pattern           | Description                                                                      |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Singleton**        | Ensures only one instance of a class is created and provides global access    |
| **Factory Method**   | Defines a method for creating objects without specifying the exact class      |
| **Abstract Factory** | Creates families of related objects without binding them to specific classes  |
| **Builder**          | Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation        |
| **Prototype**        | Creates new objects by copying existing ones instead of instantiating anew    |

### 🏛️ **Structural Patterns** – Deal with class and object composition

| Pattern        | Description                                                                 |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Adapter**        | Allows incompatible interfaces to work together                           |
| **Bridge**         | Decouples abstraction from implementation, allowing both to vary          |
| **Composite**      | Treats individual objects and compositions uniformly                      |
| **Decorator**      | Dynamically adds responsibilities to objects                              |
| **Facade**         | Simplifies a complex subsystem by providing a unified interface           |
| **Proxy**          | Acts as a placeholder or surrogate for another object                     |

### 🧠 **Behavioral Patterns** – Deal with communication between objects

| Pattern               | Description                                                             |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Chain of Responsibility** | Passes requests along a chain of handlers                           |
| **Iterator**                | Provides sequential access to elements without exposing internals   |
| **Mediator**                | Facilitates communication between objects via a mediator            |
| **Memento**                 | Captures and restores an object's internal state                    |
| **Observer**                | Notifies multiple objects about state changes                       |
| **State**                   | Allows objects to change behavior based on internal state           |
| **Strategy**                | Enables selecting an algorithm at runtime                           |
| **Template Method**         | Defines the program skeleton, letting subclasses fill in the steps  |
